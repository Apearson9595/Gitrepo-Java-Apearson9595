# Exercise: getting used to git

This repository contains an example Java project. Your task is to use git tools to get your own copy on your development machine, make a change and then use git tools to update the version stored on the GitHUb server.

1. Make sure that the **git** command is in your command path. The easiest way to do this is to use **Git Bash**: select your Eclipse workspace in the file browser, then right click and select "Git Bash Here". When the Git Bash command window appears, type ``git --help`` and you should see a page or two of "help".
2. Use ``git clone`` to get a duplicate (clone) of the remote repository on your development machine.
